# Assigning a variable

In stata, we assign variables by doing this:

```
gen var1 = "a"
```

In R, we assign variables by doing this:

```{r}
var1 = "a"
```

or this

```{r}
var1 <- "a"
```

This is nice, because it makes it easier to see the difference between "=" (assigning) and "==" (a question). In R, we have "<-" (assigning) and "==" (a question).

# What kind of variables can we have?

```{r}
# character/string
var1 <- "a"
print(var1)

# numeric
var2 <- 3
print(var2)

# categorical/factors
var3 <- factor(3,levels=c(1,2,3),labels=c("low","medium","high"))
print(var3)

var3 <- factor(2,levels=c(1,2,3),labels=c("low","medium","high"))
print(var3)
```
