# i want to change the value in the 2nd position
var[2] <- 1000
print(var)

# i want to change the value in the 1st position to 8
var[1] <- 8

# i want to make the 3rd value equal to the first value plus the second value
var[3] <- var[1] + var[2]

# i want to check that the 3rd value is equal to the first value plus the second value
